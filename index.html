          <h2>Bio</h2>
          <p>
            I graduated high school early and left for basic training entering the US Army two days after. After basic, due to my job as a 33W Military Intelligence Systems Maintainer/Integrator, I did almost a year of job specific schooling (AIT.) The job schooling covered everything from electronic engineering where we learned to replace electronic components down to the lowest replacable units to running software and systems we've never been exposed to as well as in languages we did not know and being able to troubleshoot them to get them functional on a software and firmware level to network administration of windows, linux, and unix networks including the workstations, servers, routers and other components to running of fiber, cat5, video and audio cabling throughout secured areas. My longest non-deployment role under this title was as Shop Foreman of the 111th MI Bde computer repair shop. The shop was tasked with repairing computers, servers, printers, routers, switches on hardware and software levels as well as installing, maintaining and troubleshooting surveillance systems throughout the installation to include cameras, microphones, dvrs, tvs, etc. For this position, I spearheaded the revamping of ticket handling processes which increased productivity by over 150% and decreased stale ticket rates by 90%.

            After the army, I wanted to enjoy life and began learning Texas Holdem Poker. I had always known the rules, but I really dived into learning it diving towards and expert level beyond the rules. Within the first year, I had four five figure cashes from large tournaments and felt successful in this venture. I moved from Cali where there were many casinos to Texas where some family was and a month later the US Govt. indicted the poker sites freezing all American player's money and ability to play on their websites.  At this time, I ended up starting work as a Sales Representative and during that I found Udemy and signed up for a coding course to learn it as a hobby. Through my googling while doing the course, I discovered that it was possible to get into the software development field without a degree and dove head first into learning. I started my first position as a software developer in 2018, though the company forced me to relocate to NYC with a salary I had agreed to for Austin, TX. The salary ended up being impossible to live and I had to leave the job at just under a year with Neuberger Berman. After this, I ended up moving to Las Vegas and going back to poker to regain funds as the cost of NYC was drastic and depleted me. I continued the job search while playing, but had no luck finding another job placement and started leaning more and more towards playing poker longer hours due to Covid making things uncertain overall in the country. I discovered I had a benefit from the VA that would cover the cost of attending a coding bootcamp and was going to expire that year, so in 2021 I applied to Code Fellows and began working on getting some new skills and hopefully making my resume more appealing to hiring managers.
