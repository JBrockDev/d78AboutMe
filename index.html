            I joined the US Army at the age of 17 following early graduation. In the army, I worked as a 33W Military Intelligence Systems Maintainer/Integrator. This job actually entails quite a bit, the job training for it was nearly a year long with no breaks. We learned everything from electronic engineering - troubleshooting and finding the lowest replaceable unit to troubleshooting software problems and fixing them to network administration of windows, unix & linux workstations, servers, and routers to running fiber, cat5, audio and video cables throughout skiffs (secured buildings, which generally have multiple internal networks and possibly one external network.)

            Being that I left for basic training literally two days after early graduation, when I received my honorable discharge from the military at the end of my enlistment, I felt like relaxing and enjoying life as a youthful, active individual. It was at this time that I started learning Texas Hold'em poker. Now, I played it in the past, but I don't consider knowing the rules and playing a house game to have learned poker. People who say they know poker typically know .1% of poker. There's so much more beyond that. I devoted my next year to learning and practicing poker. I typically focused on multi-table tournament poker as the cash and tournament poker playing is a LOT different. Towards the end of this first year was when I hit my first big tournament placement. I took down a Full Tilt Poker FTOPS event for first place. This may seem like an ordinary win, but the FTOPS series were tournaments that are extremely low buyin with HUGE fields of players and the money is distributed to even fewer payout places than typical tournaments. It was around a $15 buyin tournament and the first place prize was over $70,000 USD.

            It was March 2011, I decided since online poker was going well for me that I'd move from California, where there's many casinos, to Texas where I'd have to play only online poker. Unfortunately, April 15, 2011 was a bad time for poker players. You'll likely think Black Friday is something that comes after Thanksgiving, however Black Friday in the poker world refers to this grave day in April. The United States Department of Justice indicted the three sites I played on: PokerStars, Full Tilt Poker, and Absolute Poker. All funds in the websites were frozen and a lot of people to this day still haven't gotten their money from their balances. I still have over $50,000 USD stuck in limbo that I'll likely never see again.

            After poker became a thing of the past for me, due to location having no casinos, I started getting into online gaming more heavily as I did prior to poker. In 2012, I hit the rank of Diamond in League of Legends, which is high even today, but back then was fewer people. I just relaxed and practiced for a year and in 2013, I broke into the top 5 ranking for players in North America. It was at this time that I started streaming on Twitch and within three months, I became a partnered streamer. Granted, most streamers were popular because of skill at the time, not being entertainers themselves. Twitch partner was also a lot harder to get at the time, way before the Amazon buyout of Twitch. I kept streaming through to 2016 at which time I quit gaming and in kind streaming due to some outside influences. I ended up trying out the sales industry as a Sales Rep for an inbound call center Sitel, where I often reached top sales monthly to receive bonuses and prizes by upselling AT&T services through extensive product knowledge and technical knowledge conveyed to customers calling in.

            While working in sales, I discovered Udemy in my off-time. I originally picked up a Java course by Tim Buchalka to learn as a hobby as I'd always been interested in coding. Through some of my googling while working through this course, I discovered it had been becoming increasingly more acceptable to not have a college degree and get a software developer position. I spent the next four months working on learning everything I could about web development as it seemed one of the easier entry points. At this time, I had gotten a job offer from a company FDM Group, which I should've listened to complains as they ended up being true. FDM Group is a company that trains and places individuals into their client's company. I was pretty much promised that I'd work in Austin for the salary I agreed to, however, after a client in NYC wanted me onboard I was forced to relocate at my own expense as well as on the same salary as Texas. Texas has no state income tax and a lower cost of living, so this was pretty drastic to what I agreed. I wanted the experience though, so I went with it. Unfortunately, bills there and my credit obligations made it impossible for me to stay and after just under a year, I had to leave the position.

            As I'd relocated out of Texas and was going to have to move anyways, I decided to relocate to Las Vegas to play poker again while I started the job search once more. I ended up having a lot of success again, the first month running up $5 to nearly $20,000. I kept on the job search, but the corona virus lockdown had hit things hard and I kept hearing back that I didn't have a college degree, so eventually I just switched to playing poker more and more. In 2021, I learned that I had an educational benefit from the VA that I was previously unaware of and was going to be expiring, so I researched coding bootcamps and was choosing between Hack Reactor, Codingdojo, and Code Fellows. My first choice was Hack Reactor, however I got connected with a student that was almost done with the bootcamp and noticed that their quality was severely degraded from when I researched Hack Reactor in 2017. My second choice was Codingdojo as I had previously spoken with hiring managers who praised codingdojo alumni. Unfortunately, Codingdojo lost it's VA eligibility for reasons that weren't disclosed to me, so that was no longer an option. An article I had read previously showed statistics of schools and Codefellows was shown to be the best for getting into the top tech companies. I then spoke to some veterans that were in the course and I was convinced that Code Fellows would be my next stop. I'm hoping that attending this will refresh my resume after the gap from my first developer position and open more doors due to not being a college graduate.

          <p>Since I started learning in 2017, I've also been working daily on coding projects for an online community I am co-founder of so don't think I ever stopped coding. I have created multiple bots for twitch, discord, patreon, and twitter. I've used the tmi.js library for twitch, discord.net and discord.js libraries for discord, tweepy library for twitter, and patreon API. The most extensive part currently is the discord bot portion, where I have basically replaced the work of a dozen 'premium' bots that charged monthly fees for things like chat moderation, logging, etc as well as added in my own unique functionality giving community members a better quality of life. The bots also use a database currently hosted on Azure, though previously I used AWS. I also built .NET APIs for the bots based on their need of the data stored. I'm always looking for new ways to do things to improve the customer experience.</p>
