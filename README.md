## About Me

This was a project for the Code Fellows 'Code 201' course. Our goal was to make guestions with prompts and responses via alerts.

We started with yes or no questions and then moved onto a number guessing game. After the number guessing game, we introduced an array of correct answers. The final result was a function that will take in any question whether it's a yes or no question, number, array of numbers, or array of words as well as offering varied attempts regardless of the question.

We also worked with CSS a little bit. The header is set to a fixed position to be at the top of the page even when scrolling. The sections for information below bio are floated to the left to be on the same line as one another. The bio section has width set to 66% of screen size and margin of 16.6% to be positioned in the middle 2/3 of the screen.
